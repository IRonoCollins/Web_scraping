# Web Scraping: Extracting a Table from a Website

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to scrape a table from a website using Python and BeautifulSoup. The extracted data is processed and saved in a structured format for further analysis.

## Features
- Scrapes tabular data from a webpage
- Cleans and structures the extracted data
- Saves the data to a CSV file for further analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python
- BeautifulSoup (for web scraping)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Requests (for fetching webpage content)

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Scraping a Table from a Website.ipynb"
   ```
2. Execute the cells step by step to scrape, clean, and save the data.

## File Structure
```
ðŸ“‚ Web Scraping Project
â”œâ”€â”€ Scraping a Table from a Website.ipynb  # Jupyter Notebook with the scraping script
â”œâ”€â”€ Company_Data.csv                       # Extracted data (if executed)
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                              # Project documentation
```

## Notes
- Ensure that the website you are scraping allows web scraping (check its robots.txt file).
- Modify the URL and table selection logic if extracting data from a different source.
